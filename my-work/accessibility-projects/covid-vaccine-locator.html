            <p class="mb-3">
                This research project profoundly shaped my understanding of accessibility as both a technical
                discipline and a social justice imperative. Hearing participants describe their frustration,
                exhaustion, and ultimately their loss of independence was deeply moving.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-3">
                One participant, P4, spent over an hour trying to complete a single registration form. When
                they finally gave up and said, "I guess I'll just have to ask my husband to do it for me,"
                the defeat in their voice was palpable. This was someone who managed their entire life
                independently—paid bills online, ordered groceries, worked a professional job—yet a poorly
                designed vaccine website stripped away that autonomy.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-3">
                What struck me most was how preventable these barriers were. Every single issue we identified
                had well-documented solutions in WCAG guidelines. These weren't edge cases requiring novel
                technical solutions—they were failures to implement basic accessibility best practices.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-0">
                This research reinforced my commitment to accessibility advocacy in my career. I now approach
                every design and development decision by asking: "Who am I excluding with this choice?"
                Accessibility isn't a feature to add later—it's a fundamental requirement for equitable,
                human-centered technology.

                As the COVID-19 vaccine became available, national and local governments directed people to websites to
                find information about vaccine locations and appointments. People who are blind access websites with
                screen readers, which often skip over data visualizations like maps, charts, and graphs. Due to this,
                people who are blind have difficulty accessing critical information about COVID-19.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-0">
                We conducted remote and in-person usability tests on the Chicago COVID-19 vaccine locator website with
                eight participants, four people who were blind and four who were sighted. We uncovered and analyzed
                usability and accessibility problems, including indirect pathways to information, lack of clear and
                concise language, and lack of user control and freedom. Our recommendations for future website design
                iterations include prioritizing information, reducing reliance on recall, consistency, and appropriate
                use of elements, alt tags, and ARIA.

                    We recruited eight participants, four people who were blind and four people who were sighted,
                    through personal and professional connections. The average age of participants who were blind was
                    68.75 years. Three participants who were blind resided in the Chicago area, while one resided
                    outside the Chicago area. All the participants who were blind used JAWS as their primary screen
                    reader. The average age of participants who were sighted was 29.3 years. Two participants who were
                    sighted resided in the Chicago area, while two resided outside the Chicago area. All participants
                    had an interest in improving access to COVID-19 vaccines.

                <p class="mb-3">
                    We conducted usability tests remotely and in person. Each session lasted 30 to 45 minutes and had a
                    moderator and notetaker. We began each session by reading the consent form to all participants, and
                    we allowed for participants to ask questions and verbally consent to the study. Then, we asked
                    participants about their experience finding information about COVID-19 vaccine locations, setting up
                    appointments, and commuting to them.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-3">
                    We instructed participants to share their screens and navigate to the Chicago COVID-19 vaccine
                    locator website. We asked participants to browse the website's homepage and describe their first
                    impressions. We instructed participants who were blind to use their screen reader at their typical
                    speed. Next, we asked participants to complete the following four tasks:
                </p>

                            <strong>Task 1:</strong> Imagine you want to find a place to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Using
                            this website, please show me how to find a COVID-19 vaccine location near you?
                        </li>

                            <strong>Task 2:</strong> You've heard that pharmacies such as CVS and Walgreens also offer
                            vaccines. Please walk me through how you would find which pharmacies offer COVID-19
                            vaccines?

                            <strong>Task 3:</strong> You received your first and second dose of the COVID vaccine about
                            three months ago. You are looking to see if you can schedule your first booster (third
                            shot). How would you go about figuring this out?
                        </li>
                        <li class="mb-0">
                            <strong>Task 4:</strong> You've heard that Chicago is offering in-home vaccinations. Where
                            would you find information about this, and how would you schedule an appointment?
                        </li>

                <p class="mb-3">
                    Due to time constraints, we did not present Task 3 to one participant (P2), nor Task 4 to three
                    participants (P2, P3, P5). After each task, we asked all participants to rate the task on a Likert
                    scale of one to five, with one being easy and five being difficult. Additionally, we recorded
                    whether participants experienced failure or success on each task.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-3">
                    To conclude, we asked all participants to rate the likelihood that they would use a website like the
                    Chicago COVID-19 vaccine locator on a Likert scale of one to five, with one being unlikely and five
                    being extremely likely. Finally, we asked open-ended questions to solicit additional feedback about
                    their experience with the website.
